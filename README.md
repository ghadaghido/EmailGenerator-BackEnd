# Email Deriver Application

## Overview

This project includes a React frontend and a Node.js backend designed to derive email addresses. Given a person's full name and company domain, the application predicts their email address based on known formats within a sample dataset.

## Backend

- *Technology*: Node.js with Express
- *Functionality*: Derives email addresses based on two formats (first_name_last_name and first_initial_last_name) using sample data.

## Frontend

- *Technology*: React
- *Features*: A simple UI to input a full name and domain, and then displays the derived email.

## Usage

1. *Run Backend*: Navigate to the backend directory and start the server (node server.js).
2. *Run Frontend*: In a separate terminal, go to the frontend directory and launch the React app (npm start).

## Note

The application is a prototype and uses static sample data for deriving email formats. It is designed for demonstration purposes and lacks authentication and advanced error handling.
